# Soap Bubble Simulation
Graphics Final Project by Brandon Boras &amp; Nicholas Perell. This started off as just a visual simulation for thin film interferance, and it ended up slightly ballooning into a myriad of other features and graphical settings. As it is implemented in Unity, most of the shader's options are actually available through

`Usese Unity 2020.2.1f1`
